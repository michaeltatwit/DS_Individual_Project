## Introduction

    This project will be examining trends in player stats among National Basketball Association (NBA) end of season awards. First, it is important distinguish the awards that will be examined, as well as what they mean for a player to recieve the award.

### Awards Overview

    Most Valuable Player (MVP): Arguably the most prestigious award of them all, the MVP award goes to the overall "best" player of the NBA season, which is usually the player that is most important to the team. However, fans don't always agree with the chosen MVP and there is constant debate on who it should be.

    All-NBA First Team: At the end of the season, there are three teams of players from different teams named to an All-NBA team. The All-NBA teams consist of three teams, All-Nba 1st, 2nd, and 3rd team, in which 1st is the most prestigous of the three. The 1st team consists of 5 players who have played the best basketball out of anyone in the league in the previous season, and also consists of the NBA MVP. It is important to note that the ALL-NBA First team is in the same format as the starting 5 in basketball: 2 guards, 2 forwards, and a center.

    Most Improved Player (MIP): This award is given to the player who has shown the most growth between last season and the current season. It is usually given to an under the radar player, but can also be given to a big name if they improve enough.

### Analysis of Awards

    For Most Valuable Player, this project will explore the historical data to identify the minimum statistical thresholds across the main categories (points, assists, rebounds, steals, and blocks) that players have achieved in past seasons to win the MVP award. Additionally, we will examine the team performance aspect, specifically the minimum team seed required for a player to be considered for the MVP. This analysis aims to establish a benchmark for what it takes statistically and team-success-wise to win the MVP award and to predict who might win the MVP in the 2023-24 season based on current statistics and team standings.

    For the All-NBA First team, the project focus will be on determining the relationship between a player’s scoring efficiency, particularly true shooting percentage, points per game (PPG), and their likelihood of being named to the All-NBA First Team. By analyzing historical data, we aim to understand how scoring efficiency correlates with selection for the All-NBA First Team and use this relationship to forecast the 2023-24 All-NBA First Team selections based on players’ performance metrics during the current season.

    For Most Improved player, this project will investigate the statistical benchmarks, such as increases in points per game, shooting percentages, and rebounds per game, that are common among past winners of the NBA Most Improved Player award. The goal is to identify a set of significant performance improvements that indicate a player's eligibility for the MIP award and use these benchmarks to predict the 2023-24 MIP based on the current season's data.
